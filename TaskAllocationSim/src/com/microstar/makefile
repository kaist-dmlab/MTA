# Order matters here.  kernel should be first, then actors, then domains
# so that when we compile in a directory we should have already compiled
# any classes in other directories that we depend on.
#
# doc directory should be last so we get files from version control before
# updating the docs
#DIRS = kernel actors domains pitcl doc graph data
